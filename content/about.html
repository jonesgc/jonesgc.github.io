            Throughout my time enrolled on the Computing course at UWE I have been exposed to or actively used many programming languages. Outside of my time at UWE I have started to use some of these programming languages personnally, mainly for experimentation or simply to practice problem solving or learn a new area of a lanaguage I had not been required to use at University.<br><br>
            
            I have used in some manner the following programming/scripting languages:
            <ul id = "aboutProgrammingList">
                <li>
                    C
                </li>
                <li>
                    C++
                </li>
                <li>
                    Python 3
                </li>
                <li>
                    PHP
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Java
                </li>
                <li>
                    Javascript
                </li>
                <li>
                    HTML + CSS
                </li>
                <li>
                    SQL
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Whilst using these programming language we also used XML and JSON technologies to help manage data.
