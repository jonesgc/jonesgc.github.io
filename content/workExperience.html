        Voluntary work refurbishing and preparing donated computers for shipping to educational facilities and other charities in Africa.

        Donated computers would come from the community, local businesses, and larger entities such as the NHS trust in Cheltenham. Our work as volunteers as volunteers was to inspect each donated computer and prepare them for shipment. This process would entail troubleshooting, replacing faulty components, salvaging usable components from unusable machines and deployment of new Operating systems.

        Average work load would depend on level of donated computers, at times this could be a few hundred due to donation by a local NHS facility. During my time at the charity I developed my experiences with Linux and expanded my existing knowledge of computer hardware. Time at the charity involved working with full time employees and a wide range of volunteers from a wide range of backgrounds which enriched the experience.

        During the Cheltenham Festival, the Gold Cup race meet, working as a Betting Assistant was very exciting.  An energetic environment meant that working to a high degree of accuracy in handling money was challenging but a rewarding experience.
