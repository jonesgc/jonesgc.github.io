            Computing at UWE entails more than learning theoretical aspects of: Programming (C, C++,PHP, JAVA, Python and more), System design, Software Engineering practices and network systems; but an exploration into how they are applied in the real world through a range of projects designed to encourage skills that can be transferred into the professional world. 

            Unless otherwise stated all modules had an examination as part of the assessment for that module. Additionally these modules listed were the ones I personally did, in the third year we could select which two modules to do out of five choices.

                    Research and Build a Prototype Implementation: The focus of this assignemnt was a currency converter. This required the use of an external API then the creation of our own service which could provide currency conversions to a website. We were mandated to use XML as part of the functionality for this project, in addition to PHP, HTML, JS etc. The use of XML was to store the values returned from the external APIs and allow our own functionality to use it as a source.

                    Coursework Based on the Lab Experiences: Over the course of this module we undertook a range of tasks in the tutorial sessions, such as implementing views on an SQL Database. All these topics were then included in some way into the Coursework which required us to individually perform similar tasks to what we did in the tutorial but often to a greater degree of complexity. This included performing a normalisation process on a case study and the generation of a functional Databases design on the senario. In addition to SQL this coursework also included a segment on NoSQL, which we used MongoDB, were the requirement was to translate the SQL design into a NoSQL solution.

This report had to be needed to be current to a degree which means it had to touch on GDPR which was a large focus of this module on this year, since it is was 2018 that GDPR came into effect. Our choice of topic also had to relate to members of a small team for the other part of the assessment for this module the Group Presentation.
                    <br><br>
                    Group Presentation: In teams of around 4 we had to research an area, in which our Individual Report should have focused on an area. Then from this research build a presentation on the Ethical and Professional Issues in this area, this meant often referencing the code of ethics (were available) for relevant organisations like IEEE, ACM and the examination of legislation such as GDPR.

                    Report (Disseration): The Computing Project module is the largest module in terms of number of credits available, additionally it was the only module to run the course of both final semesters in the final year. The assignment can be divided into two elements, the the report and the software created as a result of the research for the report and used in the demonstration assignment of this module. The report element was on a topic of your own choosing, with input from a Supevisor relating to topic area for example if the topic chosen was on Web Technologies then the supevisor is ideally a lecturer with knowledge in that area. After the topic is selected work on the research for the project could beign, this research had be focused mainly on acedemic sources in reputable publications such as IEEE. The remainder of the report would be on the design of the software being created as a result of your research and the methodology behind your process. This project incorporated all of the elements taught in the other modules in all three years of the course.
                    <br><br>
                    Demonstration: This demonstration was conducted to your project supevisor and a seccond marker. Focused on displaying the functionality of the software you had created and asnwering questions on the software and the report for your project.

                    Log book: This consisted of three tasks that needed to be completed. These tasks centred about the use of the BBC Microbit to teach IoT concepts. The first task was an introduction into the BBC Microbit and as such it required the creation of some form of game on the Microbit, this helped introduce the hardware we had available on the Microbit such as the accelerometer. The seccond task was to pass some form of messages from one Microbit to another, with the requirement that the message be encrypted in some form. This also required the user to be able to input a message on one microbit then see it displayed on the other connected microbit, this task used a wired connection between the microbits. The third task required using a wireless connection method to perform a similar function as the seccond task. An option was given in the thrid task to use Blue Tooth Low Energy to do something.
                    <br><br>
                    Presentation: Requiring research into an aspect of IoT, such as use of IoT in smart cities, then the creation of a written essay and a presentation to a lecturer and some peers on a topic of your choice relating to the essay.
